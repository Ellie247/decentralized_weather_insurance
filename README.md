# decentralized weather insurance

Group project (09/2025): EVM-based smart contract with react app for the blockchain challenge @University of Basel.

## Needed installations (not covered here)

- npm, hardhat, metamask

## Quick startup guide

  - To just run the contracts, go into contract folder (`cd contract`).
  - Install necessary dependencies (should be done automatically at first startup) . Sometimes `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts` is needed once.
  - To build project: `npx hardhat compile` or `npx hardhat build`.
  - To then run test, use `npx hardhat test` or `npx hardhat coverage`.
  - End with: `npx hardhat clean`.
  - To run react app: go to client folder (`cd client` from project root).
  - Run `npm start`. The website should be at `localhost:3000`.
